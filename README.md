# AP-FRQs-2025

*Solutions written by Eric Gao*

## Introduction
This repository contains my solutions and reflections for the AP Computer Science exam taken on [05/07/25]. While reviewing the released questions, I've documented my approach, insights gained, and areas for future growth.

## Exam Experience
In this section, I reflect on my overall experience taking the AP Computer Science exam:

- My preparation strategy for the exam included reviewing every unit that I found less straightforward than others, such as classes and inheritance.
- The most challenging aspects of the exam were understanding how different large numbers in a for-loop will affect an algorithm. 
- Time management techniques that worked well for me were taking a break from Youtube and games near test day. This gave me a lot of extra time to study.
- Mental strategies I used when encountering difficult questions were sketching out the question with memory diagrams or create my own test case to see what an algorithm did. 
- After finishing the FRQs early, I realized I made a lot of small mistakes, so it is a good idea to double check your work and reread the questions after you are done.

## Niche Topics to Know
- Short Circuiting
- && has a higher precedence than ||, use () if you want to || to go first.
- Arrays that are changed inside another method are also changed for the original variable because they are a reference type.
- compareTo() can be treated as a subtration sign. Example, the ascii value for a is 97 and b is 98. "a".compareTo("b") will return -1. You do not need to know the extact values for a and b just know that b is 1 greater than a and c is 2 greater than a and etc.
- When removing objects from arrays, you must go backward.
- int/int = int (decimals might be lost)
## Growth Opportunities
Through this review process, I've identified these areas for continued learning:

- Topic/Concept 1: Different values in a for-loop and how it affects an algorithm. 
- Topic/Concept 2: Writing complex inheritance.

## Resources
Resources I found helpful during my exam preparation and review:

- Well Explained Full Course Playlist [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjRvQbWsTfM&list=PLmpmyPywZ440vPqpAPeUkE-TeKifbS45W](url) (copy-paste link if it doesn't work)
- Doing all of College Board's Progress Check at April/May
- Albert.io multiple choice questions

## Future Goals
Moving forward, I plan to:
- Develop a game during the summer.
- Study different algorithm and understand them deeply. 
- Learn new coding languages and see how they differ. 
- Study my exams earlier, rather than a few days.
