# AP-FRQs-2025

*Solutions written by Eric Gao*

## Introduction
This repository contains my solutions and reflections for the AP Computer Science exam taken on [05/07/25]. While reviewing the released questions, I've documented my approach, insights gained, and areas for future growth.

## Exam Experience
In this section, I reflect on my overall experience taking the AP Computer Science exam:

- My preparation strategy for the exam included reviewing every unit that I found wasn't straight forward as other such as classes and inheritance  
- The most challenging aspects of the exam were understanding how different large numbers in a for-loop will affect an algorithm. 
- Time management techniques that worked well for me were taking a break from Youtube and games near test day. This gave me a lot of extra time to study.
- Mental strategies I used when encountering difficult questions were sketching out the question with memory diagrams or create my own test case to see what an algorithm did. 
- After finishing the FRQs early, I realized I made a lot of small mistakes, so it is a good idea to double check your work and reread the questions after you are done.
  
## Growth Opportunities
Through this review process, I've identified these areas for continued learning:

- Topic/Concept 1: Different values in a for-loop and how it affects an algorithm. 
- Topic/Concept 2: Writing complex inheritance.

## Resources
Resources I found helpful during my exam preparation and review:

- Well Explained Full Course Playlist [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjRvQbWsTfM&list=PLmpmyPywZ440vPqpAPeUkE-TeKifbS45W](url) (copy-paste link if it doesn't work)
- Doing all of College Board's Progress Check at April/May
- Albert.io multiple choice questions

## Future Goals
Moving forward, I plan to:
- Develop a game during the summer.
- Study different algorithm and understand them deeply. 
- Learn new coding languages and see how they differ. 
- Study my exams earlier, rather than a few days.
