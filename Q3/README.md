## Question 3 Analysis
### Competitors

This section contains my analysis of Question 3 (Arrays and Arraylist):

#### My initial approach during the exam:
- Part A you had to create the Round Construtor. I did this by initializing competitorList to be a ArrayList of Competitor. Then I loop through the names list and add the values into the competitorList with the rank. 
- Part B you had to create a buildMatches method that returns an ArrayList. I check if the the competitorList has an even amount of player then match the best player to the worst and loop it. If the player is an old number you have to skip the best player.
#### My revised solution after review:
- Part A, I had the same thing.
- Part B, I made it a lot shorter by combining the for loops together. 
  
#### Key concepts tested in this question:
- Key concepts tested in this question was knowing how to loop values into an array list and how to create one. 
- The tricky part about part A was when adding to the arraylist you must do new Competitor(...). I can imagine that most people left out the keyword new.
- It test the concept of modulus. 
#### What I learned from revisiting this problem:
- I realized for Part B you can simplified the code by half.
