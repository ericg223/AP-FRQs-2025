## Question 1 Analysis
### Dog Walker

This section contains my analysis of Question 1 (Methods and Control Structures):

#### My initial approach during the exam:
- My first step for each FRQ was to copy the method title. I then read the question and compare the number of dogs. Last I return the value depending on the result of the comparison.
- For part B, I copy the method title again. I put a count variable and named it result. The variable represent how much money the walker earned. I then loop through every hour and called the walkDogs method. I then use a if statement to see if it meets the bonus pay requirment. Then I add to the pay by the number of dog by 5 for each hour. 
  
#### My revised solution after review:
- I did the same thing, but faster. 
  
#### Key concepts tested in this question:
- Key concepts tested in this question were if statements and calling methods. 
- For part B, it tested on loops and if statement. It also test if you know how to create variable to return.
