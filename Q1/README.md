## Question 1 Analysis
### Dog Walker

This section contains my analysis of Question 1 (Methods and Control Structures):

#### My initial approach during the exam:
  My first step for each FRQ was to copy the method title. I then read the question and compare the number of dogs. Last I return the value depending on the result of the comparison. 
  
#### My revised solution after review:
  I did the same thing, but faster. 
  
#### Key concepts tested in this question:
  Key concepts tested in this question were if statements and calling methods.
