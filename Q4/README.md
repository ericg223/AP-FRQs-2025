## Question 4 Analysis
### Puzzle Game

This section contains my analysis of Question 4 (2D arrays):

#### My initial approach during the exam:
  For part A, we had to initialize puzzle then loop through the 2D array and assign it a random number between 1 and 9 (inclusive). 
  For part B, I notice that the idea it was testing was similar to a project we did in class. We remade Conway's Game of Life. The diffcult part of part B was noticing that, while looping through the array we must exclude the orginal value. We did this by using an if statement that check if i equals row and j equals col was not true. While remaking Conway's Game of Life, we also encounter a similar problem where we had to ignore the orginal cell. 
  
#### My revised solution after review:
  I had a similar answer, while taking the exam.
  
#### Key concepts tested in this question:
  Initializing a 2D array and assigning it a value.
  Looping through an 2d array and if statement.
  Random number generator.
